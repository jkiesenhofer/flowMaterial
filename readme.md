## Collapsed buckling and bubble separation with large hydrophobic entrainments 

---
Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) is a water treatment process that removes suspended solids using air and a skimming mechanism to clarify wastewater, or a process in which contaminants are preferentially removed from a stock by attachment to air bubbles. Flotation processes involve mechanisms of froth dynamics in multiphase flows, such as coalescence and flocculation, in wastewater treatment. When particles attach to the surface of a bubble and are transported against gravity to the top surface of a stirred tank, flotation can be utilized. Moreover, when a bubble breaks into smaller, intermixed subparts, hydrophobicity in the bubble–particle interaction becomes important during the collapse and buckling of a bubble agglomeration. In our test, we elicit bubble detachment, segregation, and separation through large hydrophobic entrainments. The application illustrates precipitation with dispersed metal particles in air, and we test two PIV files that filter the velocity field using a given signal-to-noise ratio in a macroscopic material model. Direct scaling is applied uniformly with a displacement factor below 97 and an area search within extended image frames using a two-peak method with efficiency thresholds of 700. Artificial overlaps of 16 and 32 are introduced, and validation using a local mean is performed in a stratified flow within a flotation cell using Fluidmotion™ to recover particles from low-grade recycling materials. The steadiness of the kinetic flow pattern might be less sensitive to distortion than its agitation by reagents.
