## Bubble separation by large hydrophobic entrainments 

---
Flotation governs the mechanism of froth dynamics in multiphase flows as coalescence or flocculation in wastewater treatment. If a bubble is split into more subparts the hydrophobicity is of major importance during buckling. In our test we track bubble separation by large hydrophobic entrainments. The application shows a flow with 200 fluid particles and we are testing two piv-files that filter a vector plot with a given signal-to-noise ratio in a material model. Direct scaling is done uniformly with a factor below 100 and an area search of an image in extended frames with a method between two peaks by thresholds of 1.2. An overlap of 16 and 32 has been chosen and a validation with a local mean is demonstrated in a stratified flow of a flotation cell by Fluidmotion™ to recover metal particles from low-grade recycling materials.
