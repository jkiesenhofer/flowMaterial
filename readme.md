## Bubble-particle interactions as dense dispersions in wastewater

---
Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) is a water treatment process that removes suspended solids using air and a skimming mechanism to clarify wastewater, or a process in which contaminants are preferentially removed from a stock by attachment to air bubbles in weak turbulence. Flotation processes involve mechanisms of froth dynamics in multiphase flows, such as coalescence and flocculation, in wastewater treatment. When particles attach to the surface of a bubble and are transported against gravity to the top surface of a stirred tank, flotation can be utilized. Derjaguin and Dukhin have proven that the hydrodynamic fields around either a rising bubble or a falling droplet are identical. Moreover, when a bubble breaks into smaller, intermixed subparts, hydrophobicity in the bubble–particle interaction becomes important during the collapse and buckling of the bubble. In our test, we elicit bubble detachment, segregation, and separation through hydrophobic entrainments. The application illustrates precipitation with dispersed metal particles in water, and we test two PIV files that filter the velocity field using a given signal-to-noise ratio in a macroscopic material model. Direct scaling is applied uniformly with a displacement factor below 97 and an area search within extended image frames using a two-peak method with efficiency thresholds of 700. Artificial overlaps of 16 and 32 are introduced, and validation using a local mean is performed in a quasi-stratified flow within a flotation cell using Fluidmotion™ to recover particles from mud with energy dissipation rates of O(1 m²/s³). The steadiness of the kinetic flow pattern might be less sensitive to isotropic distortion than its agitation by reagents. The process is highly dependent on the size distribution of the respective particles that are encompassed by the flow. Small particles have a large relative surface area and require more reagents in the process. The problem with small particles is that they collide less often and are less efficient at attaching themselves to air bubbles. The economic exploitation of small particles has become increasingly important in recent years. Concerns about the environment have been at the forefront of various discussions. In this study, we examine the comprehensive interaction between densely dispersed particles and air bubbles.
