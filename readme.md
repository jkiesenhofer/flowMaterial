## Collapsed buckling and bubble separation with large hydrophobic entrainments 

---
Flotation processes govern the mechanism of froth dynamics in multiphase flows as coalescence or flocculation in wastewater treatment. If particles are attached onto the surface of a bubble and transported against its gravity on the top surface of a tank, we can talk about flotation. Moreover, if a bubble is split into more intermingled subparts the hydrophobicity in the bubble–particle interaction is of major importance during collapse buckling of bubble aggregates. In our test we elicit bubble detachment, segregation and separation by large hydrophobic entrainments. The application illustrates a precipitation with 200 metal particles and we are testing two piv-files that filter the velocity plot with a given signal-to-noise ratio in a macroscopic material model. Direct scaling is done uniformly with a displacement factor under 97 and an area search of an image in extended frames with a method between two peaks by efficiency thresholds of 1.2. An overlap of 16 and 32 was artificially induced and a validation with a local mean is depleted in a stratified flow of a flotation cell by Fluidmotion™ to recover particles from low-grade recycling materials. The steadiness of the kineticly convected flow pattern could be less sensitive to distortion than its agitation with reagents.
